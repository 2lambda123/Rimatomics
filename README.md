This still needs some work and will probably have frequent updates for a little while

WORKS WITH SAVES

Rimatomics is the successor to Rimushima, the 2 main features of the mod are nuclear power and energy weapons. A custom research system guides you step by step through most of the features, with certain details being left for you to figure out. The nuclear power station can produce anything from kilowatts to megawatts, with options for combinations of cooling systems, turbines and multiple cores - with upgrades. To make use of such massive amounts of power, an assortment of energy weapons has been added, high energy lasers, railguns, or just some good old fashioned nukes.

##Starting out
Go to the rimatomics tab in the normal research menu, you will see a single project, once this is complete you can build the special Rimatomics research bench, you can then access the special Rimatomics research screen via the main button next to standard research, or via the tab when clicked on a rimatomics research bench.

The research projects act as a walk through for building reactors and energy weapons
